# 3D piano

A 3D piano on the browser that can be played.

## Motivation

The main purpose of this project is to learn more about WebGL as part of my exploration to grow as a creative developer.

```
WebGL is a JavaScript API for rendering 3D graphics within a web browser, giving developers the ability to create unique, delightful graphics, unlike anything a static image is capable of.
```

This project was created using:

- Typescript
- ReactJS
- ThreeJS
- React-three-fiber
- react-three/drei
- Leva
- soundfont-player

I wanted to create something that feels and looks great while giving the user an experience they can enjoy. As the project and learning goes the possibilities expand constantly evolving the initial idea `create a 3D element on the web that can be used`.

Combining my music knowledge with WebGl I was able to create a 3D piano that can be played.
